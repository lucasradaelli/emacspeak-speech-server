Building/installing with automake
---

Follow the directions described in the INSTALL file in the root 
ibmtts-sdk folder. pyibmtts is built and installed along with 
ibmtts-sdk when using automake.

Building/installing with distutils
---

pyibmtts can be built and installed independently of ibmtts-sdk and 
the autotools process using the standard Python distutils.

In the pyibmtts folder,

1) 'python setup.py build' to build the pyibmtts extension. You must 
have already built or installed the libibmeci.so (Linux) or ibmeci.lib 
(Windows) module for this step to succeed.

2) 'python setup.py install' to install the pyibmtts extension to your 
Python site-packages folder.

NOTE
---

Changes to the pyibmtts.pyx file necessitate a rebuild of the C source 
using the Pyrex package. Get it from

	wget \ 
	http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/Pyrex-0.9.3.1.tar.gz
	tar xzf Pyrex-0.9.3.1.tar.gz
	cd Pyrex-0.9.3.1
	su
	python setup.py install
	exit

Packaging pyibmtts
---

In the pyibmtts folder,

1) 'python setup.py bdist_rpm' to package the extension binary and 
source in separate RPMs and archive files. Look in the ./dist folder for 
the final packages.

2) 'python setup.py bdist_wininst' to package the extension binary in a 
Windows installer.
