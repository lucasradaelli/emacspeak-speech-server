This open source software is intended to provide ABIs for the
Accessible Technologies (ATs) and desktops to build with so that
the TTS Runtime will work.

The upstream source code is maintained at:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/ibmtts-sdk/

The package includes both C and Python (pyibmtts) bindings.
