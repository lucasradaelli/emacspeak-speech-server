IBMTTS-DEVEL =================================================================

There are two different ways to build the TTS SDK (C and Python bindings).

1) Traditional make without libtools only builds the C bindings.

	make -f Makefile.simple

2) Automake builds both the C and Python bindings.

	sh autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/opt/IBM/ibmtts-devel
	make clean
	make 2>&1 | tee make.errs
	make install

To package the ibmtts-devel C bindings:

	rpmbuild -ba ibmtts-devel.spec

To package the Python bindings, see the INSTALL file in the pyibmtts 
folder.

GNOME-SPEECH =================================================================

To "automake" build gnome-speech with ibmtts-devel, then:

	./configure --prefix=/usr --with-viavoice-dir=/opt/IBM/ibmtts-devel
	make install

To "jhbuild" build gnome-speech with ibmtts-devel, then in $HOME/.jhbuilrc 
add the following line:

	module_autogenargs['gnome-speech'] = autogenargs + ' --with-viavoice-dir=/opt/IBM/ibmtts-devel'

	jhbuild buildone -an gnome-speech

#EOF
