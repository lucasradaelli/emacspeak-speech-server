<h1>Due Diligence Guidelines</h1>
<h2>Project Due Diligence Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Committers play a very important role in the operation
of open source projects. This document
outlines the responsibilities and explains some of the basic
concepts Committers<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>need to
understand in their role as a
committer. If you are a&nbsp; Committer, should you have any
questions after reading this document, your questions should be
submitted to the project's core team.</p>
<h3>Contributors and Committers</h3>
<p>Anyone who makes contributions to the project are considered to be
Contributors. These Contributors submit contributions such as code,
documentation, and other materials, through a number of channels
including the wikis, mailing
lists, and bug reporting system.
In general, anyone may have access to these systems. However,
passwords may be used for spam control purposes. Contributions made
through the wikis and mailing lists are generally made when
users chat and exchange ideas. Contribution of code is very rarely
made through these channels. Code contributions would more likely
be found attached to a bug report.</p>
<p>Contributors that have made significant contributions to the project
may be promoted to Committer status. A
Contributor may become a Committer once having been approved by the
project's core team. &nbsp; Committers have a responsibility to help
ensure that all "upstream" content published is appropriate.&nbsp; In
the case of wikis and mailing list posts and bug reports,
it is possible for Contributors to submit inappropriate content
without the knowledge of Committers. If a Committer finds content
on one of these systems that does not seem appropriate, based on
the standards set out in this document or based on the Committer's
good judgement and experience, they should contact the project's core
team.</p>
<p>Committers receive write-access to the project
that contributors do not have. Depending on the nature of their
participation, this may include write-access to the CVS repository, the
download
servers, and the web site. Committed content in the CVS repository
becomes immediately available to project visitors and
users. More importantly, this content is used to create daily
builds that may be downloaded by thousands of people each day and
may be incorporated into many free and commercially-available
software products. Due to the potential for downstream
redistribution, Committers are required to help ensure that
inappropriate content is not placed in the CVS repository. Content
contributed to the webpages on the Project web site is
less likely to be incorporated into software products. However, by
their nature, they may be seen by visitors to the web site and
their impact is generally more immediate.</p>
<p>Committers are usually contributors as well. In addition to
incorporating and releasing content contributed by others,
Committers may commit, often significant, contributions which they
have developed themselves. Some Comitters may never commit any
other content other than what they have authored themselves. Even
though they may be more confident in the pedigree of their own
contributions, they still need to ensure that their content is
appropriate.</p>
<h3>How Content is Received</h3>
<p>All project "upstream" content submitted through any of the channels
such as, wikis, mailing
lists, and the bug reporting system
or any of the other services, are licensed to others under the
terms and conditions of the Common Public License.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How Content is Distributed</h3>
<p>Users and recipients of project content are granted rights to the
content by the Common Public License. <br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Due Diligence Procedures</h2>
<p>A Committer cannot always assume that contributed content can be
freely used or redistributed. A Committer is obligated to ensure
the appropriate due diligence has been completed before
incorporating and redistributing content received from others. The
following three steps should be used in determining if the
contributed content is suitable for committing to Project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establish suitabiliy for the project.</li>
  <li>If applicable, determine compatibility of the
contribution's license with the BSD License.</li>
  <li>Establish appropriateness of the content of
the contribution based on the due diligence review.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three steps should be used for all "significant"
contributions. A "significant" contribution is a substantial amount
of code or content that introduces major new functionality into the
code base, or any code or module which will be distributed under
any license other than the BSD License . Once the license compatibility has
been confirmed, the
Committer, with assistance from one or more Contributors, should
complete the Project Contribution Questionnaire for the due diligence
prior to committing the
contribution to the Project project. For simple bug
fixes and minor enhancements contributed under the BSD License,&nbsp; the
Committer is expected to ensure the appropriateness of the
contribution.</p>
<p>The following information describes the guidelines to be
considered by the Committers to ensure the appropriate due
diligence has been completed on all contributions.</p>
<h3>Appropriateness of Contributions</h3>
<p>Before acepting and integrating contributions, the
Committer needs to determine if the contribution is appropriate and
necessary for the project.&nbsp; Once the Committer is satisfied with
the contribution, (e.g. license compatibility,
confidentiality, copyright rights, patents, etc.) , as well as, its
appropriateness and its availability for redistribution and
modification by the project (e.g. does not contravene
export control laws, does not contain profanity, meets acceptable
standards of code quality and coding style etc.), then the contribution
may be used.<br>
</p>
<p>If the contribution has any &#8220;legal&#8221; terms or
conditions associated with it whatsoever (other than a simple
statement saying the contribution is licensed under the BSD License)
the contribution must be approved by the project's core team before
being utilized. Possible such &#8220;legal&#8221; terms or
conditions include anything referring to &#8220;copyright&#8221;,
&#8220;patent&#8221;, &#8220;trade secret&#8221;,
&#8220;confidential&#8221;, &#8220;license&#8221; or
&#8220;rights,&#8221; or any other language purporting to grant or
reserve any rights to use or distribute the contribution, or limit
public distribution of the contribution. <br>
</p>
<p>Given the amount of time required to complete the due diligence
process on these packages, the Committer should allow sufficient
time for the appropriate due dilgence to be completed before
committing the code to the repository.</p>
<h3>Style &amp; Quality</h3>
The <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/style-guide/">GNU Programmer's
Style Guide</a> should be use when appropriate for all contributions.<br>
<h3>Third-Party Content</h3>
<p>There are cases where content redistributed at Project is not
received as a contribution under the BSD License. Rather, the content was
obtained from another source and is
redistributed under another license. The most common case is a
Committer who wishes to redistribute content maintained by another
open source project, outside of project.&nbsp; This must be approved by
the project's core team.</p>
<h3>Tracking Contributions</h3>
<p>Tracking of each contribution within a project is very important
from a legal point of view. As well, it allows for the appropriate
aknowledgement of each contributor. Currently, this information about
each contribution is typically
maintained within the standard copyright
and license notice contained within the source files. However,
it is advisable that the project maintain a GNU style <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html">Change
Log</a> file to
track the summary information about each contribution and links to
related bug reports within a project. A well maintained Change Log file
will be a valuable piece of information during the
due diligence and preparation of a major release of a project. <br>
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>To avoid downstream problems, it is a necessity to exercise the
appropriate due diligence. In addition to these specific standards,
the organization relies on Committers to exercise their own
judgment with respect to other factors that may deem the
contribution to be inappropriate for use. If a Committer has doubts
about the appropriateness of the contribution for any reason, then
that Committer should investigate and consult with the project's core
team.<br>
